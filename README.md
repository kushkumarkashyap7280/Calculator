# Calculator

A **Calculator App** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**. This is my first JavaScript project, where I focused on understanding JS in a **logical way** while implementing interactive features like **Undo** functionality.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations** (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)
- **Undo Functionality** to revert the last action
- **Responsive Design** for mobile and desktop users
- **Keyboard Support** for seamless user experience
- **Clean UI** with smooth animations

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the calculator layout
- **CSS**: For styling and animations
- **JavaScript**: For implementing logic and interactivity
